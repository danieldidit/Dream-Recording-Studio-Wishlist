My website is a Wishlist for my dream recording studio. It allows registered users to enter the product, the brand, 
the price, product category and an image of the product. It then displays all items on your wishlist on a table graph 
on a separate web page. If a user is registered and logged in they also have the ability to edit and delete items
from the list. If a user isn't registered or not logged in, they are only allowed to view the list
